# Risk-aware Motion Planning for Autonomous Vehicles: Statistical and Ethical Critique

This repository contains the final project for a comprehensive critique of the paper "Risk-aware Motion Planning for Autonomous Vehicles with Safety Specifications" by Nyberg et al. The project examines the statistical methodologies used in the paper, including probabilistic modeling and risk measures, as well as the ethical considerations surrounding safety rule violations in autonomous vehicle planning. Through simulations and analysis, this critique evaluates the strengths and limitations of the framework, providing insights into its practical and moral implications.

Included are the R Markdown file used to generate the critique and the final PDF output.
